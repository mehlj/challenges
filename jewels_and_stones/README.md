## Implementation
This program's purpose is to determine the amount of jewels `J` present in a list of stones `S`. 

Both these variables are represented as a string of characters.

For example:
```
J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb" -> 3
J = "z",  S = "ZZ"      -> 0
```

This Python program:
* Accepts user input in the form of two strings
* Loops through both strings
* Compares the contents of each character
* If the characters are the same, it increments the amount of jewels present
